# 3 Key Lessons from Choosing Community College Over Self-Taught Coding

Here's what no one tells you about learning to code on your own: having infinite options is actually a curse. I spent more time choosing which tutorial to follow next than actually writing code. I started and abandoned more projects than I care to admit. The freedom to learn anything meant I learned nothing deeply, until I did something that felt completely counterintuitive in early 2023: going back to school. 

No, I wasn’t planning to blow $100k on a Master’s in hopes of getting that promotion, or admitting that my Bachelor’s in Music Technology was entirely a waste of time. In spite of the plethora of amazing educational content available online, I decided to go back to school for coding. Specifically, Swift (iOS) software development. If you're wondering why I chose this path when there's so much free content available, here's what I learned about the real problem with self-directed coding education, and how structure became my secret weapon.

## Lesson 1: Structure Breaks Tutorial Paralysis (And Why That Matters)

I consider myself a fairly disciplined person, but if no one is keeping me accountable for my learning goals, the other parts of my life that do have a higher level of accountability—being a husband, father, playing in a cover band, fixing up my house—will completely push out the learning. Even before having kids, I still struggled to push through the hard parts of self-directed learning without losing interest or letting something else take its place.

The problem with self-directed learning isn't lack of resources. It’s decision fatigue. When you can study anything, you often end up studying nothing for long enough to really master it. I'd bounce between Swift fundamentals one day, then get distracted by the new frameworks announced at WWDC (even though I did t have an app to apply them to).

True freedom can't survive in chaos. There's no one-size-fits-all for learning styles, but I did fairly well under the structure of the standard American school system growing up. I was always a pretty decent student, and that's just how I learned how to learn. The structure of a well-defined curriculum that someone else drew up for me helped eliminate the decision fatigue that was killing my progress.

Having a clear path laid out (start here, master this, then move to that) removed the mental overhead of constantly choosing what to learn next. Instead of spending energy on curriculum decisions, I could focus that energy on actually understanding the concepts.

## Lesson 2: External Deadlines Create Internal Discipline

Here's the uncomfortable truth: I needed someone else to make me do the work. Not because I'm lazy, but because without external pressure, life's other demands will always win. That cover band gig, that home repair project, that family obligation, all have built-in accountability. Someone is counting on you. Self-directed learning? Only you are counting on you, and you're surprisingly good at letting yourself off the hook.

Having an instructor and classmates keep me accountable and moving forward during the difficult, tedious, yet essential parts of the learning process was worth its weight in gold. When you have a project due Sunday night and your classmates are going to see whether you understood the material, you find a way to push through the frustrating debugging sessions and the concepts that don't click immediately.

The magic wasn't just in having deadlines. it was in having deadlines that mattered to other people. When I was learning on my own, I could always rationalize pushing something off until tomorrow. But when you're part of a class, falling behind means letting down your study group, looking unprepared in front of your instructor, or missing out on collaborative learning opportunities.

This external structure didn't just make me more consistent; it made me more resilient. Instead of abandoning a difficult concept when it got frustrating, I had to stick with it until I figured it out. That persistence became a skill in itself that's served me well beyond the classroom.

## Lesson 3: Completion Builds Unshakeable Confidence

There's something powerful about actually finishing what you started. I can't tell you how many online courses I've started and abandoned at the 60% mark. How many GitHub repositories sit half-finished because I got excited about the next shiny thing.

But completing a structured program builds a different kind of confidence. It's not just confidence in your technical skills (though that's important). It's confidence in your ability to commit to something difficult and see it through to the end.

When you complete a formal program, you have proof that you can learn systematically, work through challenges methodically, and deliver projects on schedule. You have a portfolio of work that represents not just what you can build, but your ability to build consistently over time. You have references who can speak to your work ethic and problem-solving abilities.

Most importantly, you have the confidence that comes from knowing you didn't take shortcuts. You built projects. You debugged your own mistakes. You shipped an app to the App Store. You didn't just learn syntax, you learned how to build software people actually want to use.

That confidence shows up in job interviews, in your first weeks on the job, and in your willingness to tackle challenging projects. It's the difference between feeling like you're pretending to be a developer and knowing that you are one.
