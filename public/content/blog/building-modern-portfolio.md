# Building a Modern Portfolio with React and Tailwind

Creating a modern portfolio website requires careful consideration of technology choices, design principles, and user experience. In this post, I'll share my experience building this portfolio website using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why These Technologies?

### React and TypeScript
React provides a component-based architecture that makes it easy to build reusable UI elements. Combined with TypeScript, we get:
- Type safety and better developer experience
- Improved code maintainability
- Better IDE support and autocompletion

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, which offers:
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Consistent design system
- Built-in dark mode support
- Excellent responsive design utilities

## Key Features

1. **Dark Mode Support**
   The site automatically detects user preferences and provides a seamless dark mode experience.

2. **Responsive Design**
   Every component is designed to work flawlessly across all device sizes.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting
   - Image optimization
   - Minimal bundle size

4. **Accessibility**
   The site is built with accessibility in mind, including:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - ARIA labels where needed
   - Keyboard navigation support

## Conclusion

Building a modern portfolio is more than just showcasing your workâ€”it's about creating an experience that reflects your skills and attention to detail. Through careful technology choices and implementation, we can create fast, accessible, and maintainable websites.
