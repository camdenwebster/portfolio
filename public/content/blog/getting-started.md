I decided to start this blog for a few different reasons:

1. Build my written communication skills (essential in the AI age)
2. Build in public (document what I’m working on, for my own record more than anything)
3. Make sense of life (writing brings clarity)

As far as topics go, I’m not limiting myself here:

* QA and test automation (day job)
* Indie iOS app development 
* Parenting two young daughters
* Health & fitness
* Living with Type 1 Diabetes
* Pursuit of financial independence for my family 
* Attempts at becoming a better person than I was the day before

If you’re reading this, keep your expectations low. Nevertheless, I hope you find my experience relatable (or entertaining) and enjoy any time you spend here.
